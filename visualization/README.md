A quick mockup visualizer that pings the EventStore database for information and then displays it in a webpage

Runs this server by running 


```
run_server
```

And then opening 

```
http://localhost:8000/?dev=true/
```


Graphing framework used: highcharts(http://www.highcharts.com/). There might be better alternatives out there.
